*Design*: making an interface that works well.

No golden ratios, advanced typography in _basic_ design.

How can we create effective, basic designs?

Clutter
-------
Fastest way for better looking designs: cut down on clutter.

Some principles for reducing clutter:

### Grids
Line things up - pixel differences are definitely unconsciously noticed.

Use a system - bootstrap or whatever. Don't re-invent grids.

### Colors
Find a good color palette, don't try to build them from scratch. Play with the
colors from there, if you want.

### Fonts
Keep the number of fonts low - two different fonts is usually a good rule of thumb.

Use fancy/display fonts sparingly.

Vary weights (bold), style (italics), and transforms (uppercase, etc.)
*to differentiate bits*.

Let others do the work:

### White Space
The ultimate clutter reducer.

Lots of white space is very trendy right now, too.

### Summary
Reduce visual clutter - aim for a "clean" design.

User Experience Principles
--------------------------
*What's the most important action on your design?* Make it easy to find and use.

Big buttons - big, obvious call to action that that's what the user should do.

Pay attention to your goals. Make them easy to find and use.

Content Principles
------------------

### Less Is More

Big paragraphs are a sign of clutter.

Break into bullets if you can. Can increase readability by further adding bold
text to highlight the most important parts of the bullets. And then add more
whitespace!

### Headlines
Talk benefits, not details.

Keep it short.

Use natural, friendly language.

### Images and Imagery
Images principles:
* you can accomplish a lot with just type and screenshots
* stock photos usually look like stock photos
* remember to pay attention to file size

Lots of nice, big, free images available.

Advice
------
Remember: you don't have to be original.

Take inspiration from sites you like. Pick out the pieces you like and use them!

Quick overview of the design process
------------------------------------
1. Collect inspiration and sketch ideas - rough sketches!
2. Mock it up? Go straight to HTML if you want, but wireframing can be helpful.
3. Build it.

Don't expect to love your design right away - it'll take time before you love it.

Practice designing a lot!
