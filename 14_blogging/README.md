Don't just share your code, share your words!

Why?
----
You're a specialist: *share your expertise.*

*Meet your fellow specialists.* Collaborate at the level of sharing ideas.

Even if nobody reads what you write, it's still worthwhile. *Writing is thinking.*

What?
-----
Write articles/essays, not a "blog post".

Admirable writings fall into five categories:
* Stories
* Opinion
 * but don't attack people; don't say things are bad
 * Julia Evans: Don't feel guilty about not contributing to open source
* How To
 * motivate a thing, show how to do a thing
 * Kenneth Reitz: Growing Open Source Seeds (7/13/13)
* How Something Works
 * Allison Kaptur: Of Syntax Warnings and Symbol Tables (6/11/14)
* Review
 * experienced a thing, what it is, your experience, strengths/weaknesses, what
   is it good for? When is it best used?

So, if you have a topic, but aren't sure how to get started, which of these
types of writings is most appropriate? Bam, you have an outline.

If you don't have a particular topic, which style do you want to write? That's
a good starting point for brainstorming.

Who?
----
We're writing specialty articles for narrow audiences. No need to SEO.

Get your feed included in planetpython.org, maybe.

Weekly emails - notify them that you've written an article their subscribers
will be interested in.

Specialists will find you.

How?
----
Improve your writing: practice, read, get an editor.

Read a lot and emulate what you thought made the article particularly
effective. Also, read the whole thing, to the end. Take a moment to ask
yourself if it was effective. Either way, how could it be improved?

Ask your friends to read your drafts. Share drafts and criticisms with your
writing buddies.

When?
-----
Write infrequently. When you have something to say, when you're inspired.

How do you stay in practice, then? Write short things, instead. Reviews are
great for this. Set aside an hour to review books you read. Just a few
paragraphs. Reading with the intent to review will help you absorb the book
better, too.

Write together. Company tech blogs!
