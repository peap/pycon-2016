DDD
---

Documentation-driven development:
* like TDD, puts what *should* be before what *is*
* establishes a shared, easily-accessible, higher-level overview of the work
* provides a shared, easily-accessible metric of success
* encourages contributers and engagement of non-programmers
* binds programming effort into a coherent narrative

Django
------

Django's documentation is exemplary. What's so good about it?
* It's structured properly (tutorials, how-to, reference, topics).
* Within that structure, it's clear and consistent.
* It covers just about everything.
* It's held to the highest standards.
* It exemplifies important values (clarity, courtesy, friendliness).
* Documentation in Django is a process, not just a product.

What difference does this make?
* It makes Django easier to learn and adopt.
* It makes people better Django programmers.
* It lowers the support burden
* Makes development of Django faster and smoother.

*Software is not the only thing that develops*

(Programmers and communities of programmers also grow and improve.)

What does documentation mean in this regard?

Developing a Community
----------------------

Django's community, like its software, is stable, mature, and dependable.

Django's documentation is an important part of binding the Django community
together. Django's documentation:
* represents its attitudes
* is an implicit contract with its community
* is a commitment to standards of communication and information
* is treated as an activity, not just as content

### Attitudes
RTFM and LMGTFY represent bad attitudes. Completely unsympathetic and
discouraging. Result of regarding information and documentation as a product.

However, with information and documentation as a process and an activity to
engage in, there is a tangible difference.

Information as communicative transactions between agents:
* clarity
* intelligibility
* relevance
* comprehension
* attention to the needs and abilities of the other party
* affirmation of mutual understanding

*Good documentation shows respect.*

Django's docs set standards and expectations and a tone for communication,
especially communication with less-expert users.

Django's documentation informs its community and continues to drive it
as a community.

Developing Programmers
----------------------

Documentation
* represents an easy, excellent way in for new contributors
* is almost always a welcome addition
* raises its author's understanding to new levels

What can your project do?
-------------------------

Practical steps:
* *Structure* your documentation correctly (tutorials, how-to, reference, topics)
 * https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/#how-the-documentation-is-organized
* Make your doc policies as *rigorous* as your code policies
* *Document* your documentation.
* *Value* your documentation contributors.
* Value the *activity* of documentation and information.
* Attend a Write the Docs conference or workshop - http://writethedocs.org
* Make being a documentation manager part of someone's role.
* Spend money and time on documentation.

Documentation is becoming a movement.
