DDD
---

Documentation-driven development:
* like TDD, puts what *should* be before what *is*
* establishes a shared, easily-accessible, higher-level overview of the work
* provides a shared, easily-accessible metric of success
* encourages contributers and engagement of non-programmers
* binds programming effort into a coherent narrative

Django
------

Django's documentation is exemplary. What's so good about it?
* It's structured properly (tutorials, how-to, reference, topics).
* Within that structure, it's clear and consistent.
* It covers just about everything.
* It's held to the highest standards.
* It exemplifies important values (clarity, courtesy, friendliness).
* Documentation in Django is a process, not just a product.

What difference does this make?
* It makes Django easier to learn and adopt.
* It makes people better Django programmers.
* It lowers the support burden
* Makes development of Django faster and smoother.

*Software is not the only thing that develops*

(Programmers and communities of programmers also grow and improve.)

What does documentation mean in this regard?
